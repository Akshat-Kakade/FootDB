# FootDB
A football database management system created for my senior year high school project.

One of my first projects in the data science domain. Used libraries like pandas, numpy and matplotlib for data-drive analysis of different clubs and players based on different parameters.

The code is pretty bad but did the job of helping me understand the fundamentals of data analysis and visualisation.

The dataset comprised of 8 CSV files which were sourced from Kaggle (this is a year old project and I'm not able to find the links for these datasets)

Few of the example graphs:
