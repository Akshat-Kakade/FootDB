# FootDB  
*A football database management and analysis system*

A football database management system created as part of my senior-year high school project, focused on analyzing and visualizing football performance data using Python.

---

## Overview

FootDB is a Python-based football data analysis system developed to explore and visualize team and player performance metrics using structured datasets. The system processes multiple CSV files and provides menu-driven analysis and visual insights across attacking, defending, goalkeeping, and disciplinary aspects of football.

Originally developed as an academic project, this repository showcases early experience with data analysis, visualization, and modular program design using Python.

## Key Features

- Menu-driven analysis of football statistics  
- Club-wise and player-wise performance comparisons  
- Visualization of key metrics, including:
  - Goals scored and goals conceded  
  - Pass and cross accuracy  
  - Tackles won vs tackles lost  
  - Clean sheets and goalkeeping performance  
- CSV-based data backend for easy extensibility and modification

Notes

This project reflects early-stage work focused on understanding data-driven analysis rather than production-grade software engineering. Future improvements could include database-backed storage, interactive dashboards, and more advanced analytics techniques.
